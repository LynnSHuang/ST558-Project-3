# ST558-Project-3

1. Open up an "empty" RStudio without stuff in the workspace.  
2. Run this code from the console:  
install.packages(c("shiny", "shinydashboard", "plotly", "tidyverse", "dplyr", "ggplot2", "knitr", "caret")  
rshiny::runGitHub("ST558-Project-3", "LynnSHuang")  

NOTE: You won't necessarily need dplyr, ggplot2, or knitr to run the code. But there's some old bits of commented out code (other versions of plots) that would require them, so I've just left them in for good measure.
